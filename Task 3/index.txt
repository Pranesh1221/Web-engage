    Ques 1:-  What will be your approach to solving this issue? Explain your strategy and approach to this.
    ans:-     My approach to solving this issue would be to prioritize Task 2, as it is for a priority 
              customer whose campaign needs to go live in the next 2 days. I would inform the account 
              manager of Task 1, Manoj, that I will not be able to meet the original due date for the 
              task due to a emergency and ask for an extension of 3 days. I would then work on 
              completing Task 2 as quickly as possible to ensure that it is ready for the priority 
              customer's campaign to go live on time.

    Ques 2:-  How will you inform the 2 separate account managers of both customers about your approach? 
              Write an internal message informing Manoj (Account manager for Task 1) & Ravi (Account Manager for Task 2) 
              about your respective approach.          
    ans:-     To inform the account managers of both customers about my approach, I would send an internal message as follows:

              Subject: Update on task progress

              Dear Manoj,

               I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to meet the original due
               date for Task 1 due to a  emergency. I will be requesting an extension of 3 days for this task. 
               I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and appreciate your understanding.

               Sincerely,
               Pranesh
             ---------------------
             Dear Ravi,

               I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I will be prioritizing Task 2 due to the go-live 
               date of the campaign. I will be working on completing this task as quickly as possible to ensure it is ready on time.

               Sincerely,
               Pranesh

    Ques 3:- How will you communicate the delay of additional 3 days to the customer? (Write an
             email to the customer informing them about this).   
    ans:-   
             Subject: Delay in task completion

             Dear [Customer's name],

             I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I will not be able to meet
             the original due date for the task due to a family emergency. I will be requesting an extension 
             of 3 days for this task. I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and assure you that we
             will work diligently to complete the task as soon as possible.

            Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.

            Sincerely,
            Pranesh
